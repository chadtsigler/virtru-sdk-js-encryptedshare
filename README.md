# New App Instructions

Okay so what has been done? Well its simple, but hopefully helpful. We now have a basic app powered
by [Parcel JS](https://parceljs.org/), build system, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
CSS framework. This doesn't include a JS framework, but its easy enough to add using `npm`. I'd
suggest avoiding CDNs.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update `package.json` file with author, description, keywords, etc
- [ ] Update `LICENSE` file with copyright info
- [ ] Update this readme to reflect the application

## Production

To build this app for production

```sh
npm build
```

## Development

Development is made easy with Parcel. Just run the dev server and your changes will be reflected on
the fly.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Launch [https://localhost:1234](https://localhost:1234)
